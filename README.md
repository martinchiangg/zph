My dotfiles

Use at your own risk ;).

Much of it is adopted from others.  See individual files for credits.

Contact me if you see your code as these dotfiles have gradually grown.  I'll add you to credits.

Let me know on Twitter [ZPH](http://twitter.com/_ZPH) or [Civet.ws](http://www.civet.ws) if you're using these files. I'd love to hear about it :) and get pull requests.
